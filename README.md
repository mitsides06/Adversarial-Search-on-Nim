## Project Description
This project showcases the strategic implementation of the Minimax algorithm, enhanced with optional α-β pruning, to create an intelligent and challenging Nim game opponent.

## Repository Structure
- "main.py" : Core Python script implementing the Minimax algorithm for Nim, with options for α-β pruning and different modes of gameplay.
- "report.pdf" : Comprehensive report detailing the implementation approach, algorithm analysis, and insights on performance and parameter impacts.

## Key Features
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Core implementation of adversarial search strategy.
- **α-β Pruning:** Optional feature to enhance the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm.
- **User Interaction:** Users can choose to play against the computer or watch the computer play against itself.
- **Parameter Flexibility:** The impact of different game parameters (m, n, k) on the algorithm's performance is explored.
